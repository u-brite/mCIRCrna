## Background

Goal is to identify circadian gene signatures that demonstrate tissue chronicity (2 fold expression changes over time) compared to age and cell type in muscle.

Goal would be to use the CircAge RNA-seq transcriptomic database, and cross reference muscle transcriptomes with snRNA-seq muscle database. Genes that show chronicity (2 fold changes over time course ZT1-24) are compared to snRNA-seq profiles from Myoatlas. Expression profiles of dysregulated chronic genes (e.g. Per2) would then be compared in muscle cell populations (MTJ, FAPs, type II myonuclei, etc.). Conversely, any very dysregulated muscle genes across aging (P21, 24 months, 30 months TA) could then be cross referenced for chronicity using CircAge.
