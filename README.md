# mCIRCrna
The goal is to integrate circadian transcriptomes with muscle snRNA-seq data to identify age and cell type dependent circadian gene signatures that demonstrate tissue chronicity in muscle.

## Background

## Aims

To identify circadian gene signatures that demonstrate tissue chronicity (2 fold expression changes over time) compared to age and cell type in muscle.

- Find genes that show chronicity (2 fold changes over time course ZT1-24) from CircAge RNA-seq transcriptomic database across age for young and old adult

- Cross reference signifcant genes that epress chronicity from CircAge RNA-seq transcriptomic to Myoatlas snRNA-seq muscle database for cell specific age related for young and old adult differential expression
