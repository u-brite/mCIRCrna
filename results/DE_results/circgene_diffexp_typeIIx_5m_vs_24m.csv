Cancer cells maintain a high glycolytic rate even in the presence of oxygen, a phenomenon first described over 70 years ago and known historically as the Warburg effect. Fructose 2,6-bisphosphate is a powerful allosteric regulator of glycolysis that acts to stimulate the activity of 6-phosphofructo-1-kinase (PFK-1), the most important control point in mammalian glycolysis. The steady state concentration of fructose 2,6-bisphosphate in turn depends on the activity of the enzyme 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase (PFK-2)/fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase, which is expressed in several tissue-specific isoforms.",metabolism,"metabolism (GO:0008152); ATP binding (GO:0005524);catalytic activity (GO:0003824);fructose 2,6-bisphosphate metabolism (GO:0006003);fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 2-phosphatase activity (GO:0004331);hydrolase activity (GO:0016787);kinase activity (GO:0016301);transferase activity (GO:0016740)",
